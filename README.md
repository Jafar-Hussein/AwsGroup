# AWSGroup Web service
This is a Maven Spring Boot application that implements a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS. The project will be hosted in AWS and will be accessible via a URL for a short period of time. The project also includes a build process on GitHub Actions for testing.

The project aims to create a backend server that can be used by companies to manage their departments in different cities as well as the employees working for the company.
The application provides a RESTful API for client applications to interact with.

The project uses Spring Security to authenticate users and OAuth2 to authorize them.
The application will automatically create an admin account if it does not already exist. The username is *admin* and the password is *password*.

The application is connected to a RDS MySQL database and uses Spring Data JPA to access the data.
If the RDS MySQL database is not available, please create a MySQL database locally and update the application.properties file with the correct database URL, username, and password.

Interaction with the application can be done by using a client application created by our fellow co-students or by using Postman.
Please clone the client application from the following repository: [Frontend repository](https://github.com/KoffaRn/AWSGroupClient)


## Goal

The goal of this project is to automate the build, test, and deployment process to streamline the development flow.
This project is also about practicing the use of cloud services.
Besides learning new technologies and services, the project also aims to practices collaboration with another development team to create a client for each other's web service.
